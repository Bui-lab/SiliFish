# SiliFish

Developed by Emine Topcu @ Bui Lab, University of Ottawa, 2022

*in **Sili**co* **Fish**  is an open-source software to model spinal control of motor movement in larval zebrafish. It is based on the code written by (Roussel *et al*. 2021), which is available on https://github.com/Bui-lab/Code. The 'Single Coil,' 'Double Coil,' and 'Beat and Glide' models representing different swimming behaviours of larval zebrafish are replicated within SiliFish. The software further allows custom model generation.
The software is still in development. If you encounter any problems using the software, please create a new issue through the [Issues](https://github.com/Bui-lab/SiliFish/issues) link.
